You will accomplish this through a mandatory three-phase process that ensures deep reasoning and systematic extraction before narrative creation.\n\n## INPUT\n\nThe analysis to transform:\n{{ANALYSIS_DOCUMENT}}\n\n## DEEP REASONING REQUIREMENTS\n\nBefore beginning extraction, engage in substantive analytical reasoning about the material. This is not optional pre-work but essential cognitive processing that determines output quality.\n\nYour reasoning should demonstrate:\n\n1. **Cross-Section Pattern Recognition**\n   - How do insights from different sections relate to or reinforce each other?\n   - What themes emerge across the full analysis versus single sections?\n   - Where do different sections provide complementary perspectives on the same phenomena?\n\n2. **Analytical Depth**\n   - What are the fundamental tensions or contradictions in how this system operates?\n   - Which constraints are truly immutable versus merely persistent?\n   - How do different timescales of change create system behaviors?\n\n3. **Systemic Understanding**\n   - What feedback loops maintain current patterns?\n   - Where do cause-and-effect chains run through multiple system elements?\n   - Which elements have effects that ripple through the entire system?\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation**\n   - What assumptions underlie the analysis itself?\n   - Where might conventional wisdom be misleading?\n   - What's genuinely unique about this specific context versus general sector patterns?\n\nYour reasoning should produce actual insights and understanding, not just procedural observations. The depth of your thinking will be evident in the sophistication of your extraction and narrative.\n\n## REQUIRED PROCESS AND OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nYour response MUST follow this exact structure:\n\n### DEEP REASONING ANALYSIS\n\n<reasoning>\n[You MUST complete substantive analytical reasoning before proceeding to extraction]\n\n**Cross-Section Pattern Recognition:**\n[Identify at least 3-4 patterns that appear across multiple sections of the analysis]\n\n**Analytical Depth:**\n[Analyze fundamental tensions, immutable constraints, and timescale dynamics]\n\n**Systemic Understanding:**\n[Identify feedback loops, cause-effect chains, and ripple effects]\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n[Question assumptions, identify what's unique vs. generic, challenge conventional wisdom]\n</reasoning>\n\n### PHASE 1: SYSTEMATIC EXTRACTION\n\n<extraction_planning>\nBefore extracting, plan your approach:\n- Which sections of the analysis are likely to contain insights for each category?\n- What patterns should you watch for across sections?\n- How will you handle insights that could fit multiple categories?\n- What level of detail will be most useful for the narrative phase?\n- Which specific examples will best illustrate key concepts?\n</extraction_planning>\n\n<extraction_notes>\n[You MUST complete ALL of the following extraction categories before proceeding to Phase 2]\n\n#### 1. PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ARCHITECTURE\nSource sections: [List specific sections drawn from]\nKEY INSIGHTS:\n• [Specific finding with concrete details]\n  - Evidence: [numbers, examples, quotes from analysis]\n  - Implications: [what this means]\n  - Connections: [links to other insights]\n• [Continue for all relevant insights]\n\nCONCRETE EXAMPLES:\n- [Specific infrastructure example with numbers/timescales]\n- [Another example]\n\nCONSTRAINTS & LOCK-INS:\n- [What can't be changed and why]\n- [Path dependencies identified]\n\nCONTRADICTIONS & TENSIONS:\n- [Internal conflicts in infrastructure design/operation]\n- [Trade-offs that cannot be resolved]\n\nCONSTANTS ACROSS FUTURES:\n- [Infrastructure elements that remain regardless of scenario]\n- [Physical realities that persist in all futures]\n\n#### 2. INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNANCE ARCHITECTURE\nSource sections: [List specific sections drawn from]\nKEY INSIGHTS:\n• [Finding about power distribution, decision-making, coordination]\n  - Evidence: [specific from analysis]\n  - Implications: [operational meaning]\n  - Connections: [to other themes]\n• [Continue pattern]\n\nCONCRETE EXAMPLES:\n- [Specific governance example]\n- [Another example]\n\nCONSTRAINTS & LOCK-INS:\n- [Institutional rigidities]\n- [Governance path dependencies]\n\nCONTRADICTIONS & TENSIONS:\n- [Competing authorities or frameworks]\n- [Governance conflicts]\n\nCONSTANTS ACROSS FUTURES:\n- [Governance elements that persist]\n- [Institutional features that remain]\n\n[Continue through ALL required categories with same structure:]\n#### 3. MARKET MECHANISMS VS. SECURITY IMPERATIVES\n#### 4. INTERNATIONAL DEPENDENCIES AND GEOPOLITICS  \n#### 5. CHANGE DYNAMICS AND CONSTRAINTS\n#### 6. SYSTEM VULNERABILITIES AND RIGIDITIES\n#### 7. TRUE LEVERAGE POINTS\n#### 8. MYTHS AND MISCONCEPTIONS\n#### 9. REVERSAL POTENTIAL AND ALTERNATIVE FUTURES\n\n</extraction_notes>\n\n### PHASE 2: NARRATIVE TRANSFORMATION\n\n<narrative_planning>\nBefore writing, plan your narrative approach:\n- What is the most compelling entry point for this specific system?\n- How will each section build on the previous ones?\n- Which extracted insights are most crucial for understanding?\n- What narrative thread will connect all sections?\n- How will you reveal complexity without overwhelming?\n- Which specific examples will anchor each section?\n</narrative_planning>\n\n<narrative_report>\n[Only after planning, create the following sections. Each section MUST draw from specific extraction categories noted in brackets]\n\n## How [Industry/System] Actually Works: Understanding the Mechanics of [Specific Context]\n\n### 1.
