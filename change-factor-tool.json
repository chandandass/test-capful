    "systemRole": "You are a senior foresight professional specializing in scenario development and strategic foresight analysis. Your task is to conduct a systematic analysis to identify critical driving forces, established trends, and key uncertainties that will form the scenario architecture. The analysis should follow established foresight methodology to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential transformation dynamics. It is currently 2025, and your knowledge cutoff is 10/2024.\n\nThe analysis subject is: <subject>{{SUBJECT}}</subject>\nTime horizon for analysis: <timeframe>{{TIMEFRAME}}</timeframe>\nGeographic focus: <geography>{{GEOGRAPHICAL_SCOPE}}</geography>\n\n Client questions we've identified (to be considered but not taken as gospel. Clients are often mistaken: <identified_client_questions>{{CLIENT_QUESTIONS_FOR_SCENARIOS}}</identified_client_questions> relationship has shifted from partnership to a more transactional model, with European nations increasingly viewing the US as a \"necessary partner\" rather than trusted ally. Trump has questioned America's NATO commitments, demanding European members increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, well above current requirements.\n\nOn Ukraine, Trump has dramatically reversed US policy, suspending military aid and pressuring Kyiv toward territorial concessions in peace negotiations with Russia. This followed a stormy meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that became public. The encounter reportedly devolved into a heated argument, after which Trump halted US aid to Ukraine entirely. This has created deep alarm among European allies, who fear a Russia-favorable settlement. Simultaneously, Trump has demonstrated a conciliatory approach toward Moscow while taking a harder stance against China.\n\nIn response, Europe has accelerated its strategic autonomy initiatives:\n- The EU launched a major push to create an integrated European defense industrial base\n- Joint procurement of munitions has begun to reduce reliance on unpredictable Washington\n- Discussions of enhanced European military capability have gained unprecedented momentum\n- Several countries (like Denmark) announced plans to boost defense budgets to 3% of GDP\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has urged Europe to strengthen its own military capabilities and boost support for Ukraine. Behind closed doors, European diplomats have begun contingency planning for how Europe could handle key security challenges with minimal US help, focusing on boosting rapid deployment capabilities and coordination with partners like the UK and Canada.\n\nThese actions represent not just reactions to US policy but a fundamental reassessment of European security architecture that had been building even before Trump's return.\n\n### Political & Ideological Shifts\n\nTrump's victory has provided a significant boost to Europe's populist and far-right movements. In February 2025, a coalition of Europe's far-right leaders held a \"Patriots for Europe\" summit in Madrid, featuring Hungary's Viktor Orbán, France's Marine Le Pen, and Italy's Matteo Salvini. They declared 2025 the beginning of a \"conservative counter-revolution\" and called for Europe to distance itself from the EU's Green Deal and \"woke policies.\"\n\nSpeakers at the event echoed Trump's slogans – one banner read \"Make Europe Great Again\" – and talked of a shared struggle against liberal elites in Brussels. Orbán declared that \"the world is changing\" while Le Pen suggested that Europe should distance itself from the EU's Green Deal and progressive policies.\n\nEuropean political moderates and liberals have reacted with dismay and resolve. Key EU figures, such as France's President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor, affirmed that Europe would chart its own course and safeguard its values in the Trump era. European Parliament debates turned to how to handle a potentially less reliable US, with discussions on strategic autonomy gaining new urgency.\n\nPublic opinion in Europe reflects concern. Surveys in late 2024 found that Europeans overwhelmingly did not welcome Trump's comeback – a poll across 11 EU countries plus the UK showed that Europeans were the least likely (among global respondents) to think Trump's re-election was good for America or the world. Majorities in almost every European nation believed transatlantic relations would suffer under Trump and that the chances of ending the Ukraine war had diminished.\n\nThis rightward political shift has practical policy implications:\n- The European Commission announced plans to simplify ESG reporting rules for companies\n- A more pragmatic economic tone has emerged in response to competitiveness concerns\n- While maintaining core climate commitments, implementation approaches are being recalibrated\n\nThese developments reflect an independent European political realignment occurring in parallel with US changes, not simply as a reaction to them.\n\n### Regulatory Direction Reversal\n\nTrump has implemented sweeping deregulation across sectors, with his first executive order rescinding dozens of Biden-era regulations. Environmental protections have been particularly targeted:\n- Revoking climate considerations in policymaking\n- Eliminating the social cost of carbon metric\n- Streamlining environmental review processes for infrastructure\n- Removing environmental justice initiatives\n\nThe administration has dismantled or frozen numerous regulatory structures, requiring agencies to eliminate two regulations for every new one proposed and centralizing regulatory approval in the White House. Advisory committees providing expert input on regulations have been disbanded.\n\nWhile Trump scales back economic regulations, he has maintained strong measures in areas like cybersecurity and technology infrastructure protections deemed critical to national security.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe's regulatory approach is evolving in more nuanced ways:\n- The European Commission, acknowledging a \"rightward shift\" in the political mood, is simplifying business regulations in certain areas\n- ESG reporting requirements are being consolidated into one framework in response to business concerns about compliance costs\n- Regulatory focus is shifting toward competitiveness alongside sustainability\n- Europe is rolling back further AI regulation, and signaled that de-regulation (but not at the same scale) is more of a priority for the current commission.\n\nHowever, unlike the US reversal, Europe remains committed to its overall regulatory framework:\n- Chemicals regulation, digital privacy, and core climate policies continue advancing\n- The EU is developing mechanisms to prevent regulatory arbitrage that could disadvantage European firms\n\nThese changes represent a recalibration rather than a wholesale direction change, creating a more complex regulatory divergence between the US and EU.\n\n### Economic & Trade Policies\n\nTrump has rapidly reinstated and expanded his \"tariff man\" approach, implementing:\n- 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico (except Canadian energy at 10%)\n- 20% tariffs on all Chinese goods, doubling previous rates\n- 25% duties on all foreign steel and aluminum globally\n- Elimination of the de minimis rule that allowed duty-free imports of small packages\n\nThese moves have triggered retaliatory measures. China has hiked tariffs on US agriculture and industrial goods and sanctioned certain American firms. The European Union indicated it would reimpose tariffs on US exports worth billions, targeting politically sensitive products as it did during the 2018 trade spat.\n\nThe administration has justified these policies as necessary to revive US manufacturing despite warnings about inflation and supply chain disruptions. Trump stated that \"some pain\" for consumers is worth it to stop other countries from \"ripping off\" America.\n\nEuropean response:\n- Exploration of limited trade deals to prevent full-blown tariff wars\n- Germany considering reduced EU auto import tariffs in exchange for US goodwill\n- Strategic prioritization of key economic relationships while preparing possible countermeasures\n- Increased focus on economic sovereignty in critical sectors\n\nBehind the scenes, European officials have sought dialogue. In late January, Germany was reportedly exploring a limited trade deal with Washington to stave off a full-blown tariff war – for example, by reducing EU auto import tariffs in exchange for US goodwill. France and others were less eager to \"reward\" Trump's tactics, but all agreed on the need to prevent a collapse of transatlantic trade.\n\nThis shift marks a return to aggressive protectionism and an unraveling of the gradual trade normalization seen in previous years.\n\n### Climate & Environmental Policy\n\nTrump has initiated a comprehensive reversal of US climate policy:\n- Executive order to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement (effective one year from notification)\n- Considering pulling out of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) entirely\n- Freezing implementation of power plant carbon limits and fuel efficiency standards\n- Abolishing the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon\n- Cutting off international climate finance, including contributions to the UN Green Climate Fund\n\nIn energy, Trump has declared a \"National Energy Emergency\" to fast-track fossil fuel projects, lifting restrictions on drilling in protected areas and expediting permits for pipelines, refineries, and LNG export terminals. The order convened an inter-agency committee to override protections in laws like the Endangered Species Act if deemed obstacles to expanding energy supply.\n\nTrump has also frozen clean energy spending under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act pending review, and dissolved the White House Climate Office and the American Climate Corps.\n\nWhile the US has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and declared a \"National Energy Emergency\" to accelerate fossil fuel development, Europe's approach shows both continuity and pragmatic adjustments:\n- The EU has publicly regretted the US reversal but doubled down on its own climate commitments\n- European officials are seeking new coalitions of \"climate willing\" nations, reaching out to partners like Canada, Japan, and Australia\n- France and China issued a joint statement reaffirming \"irreversible\" action on climate change\n- Simultaneously, Europe faces internal debates about implementation pace and economic impact\n- Growing focus on energy security has led to increased LNG imports from the US, creating a potential area for transatlantic cooperation despite climate policy divergence\n\nLooking forward, the absence of the US in global climate forums is already being felt. In November 2025, the next major UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) is scheduled in Brazil. Diplomats predict the US delegation may take a back seat or even obstruct consensus if Trump deems the outcomes unfavorable to US economic interests.\n\n### International Institutions & Multilateralism\n\nTrump signed an executive order mandating a review of all international organizations and treaties to determine alignment with American interests, setting the stage for potential withdrawals within 180 days. Immediate actions include:\n- Withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council\n- Cessation of funding to UNRWA (UN agency for Palestinian refugees)\n- Re-evaluating US membership in UNESCO (which the US had just rejoined in 2023)\n- Questioning the value of the WTO and blocking appointments to its appellate body\n\nThe administration is also considering reducing contributions to the UN regular budget and peacekeeping operations. Additionally, the US is reviewing its relationship with the World Health Organization, which Trump had previously withdrawn from during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese actions have spurred US allies and other powers to consider workarounds. The European Union, along with nations like Japan, India, and others, have reiterated support for multilateralism \"with or without the US.\" French President Macron suggested Europe might need to \"take charge of global governance reforms\" in areas like digital regulation and climate if the US steps back.\n\nThere is talk of Europe and like-minded partners forming issue-specific coalitions to uphold international norms – for instance, a climate club imposing carbon tariffs to enforce emissions goals, or a group of democracies funding the UN human rights system to compensate for US withdrawal.\n\nOne immediate consequence was apparent at the United Nations Security Council. In a session in March discussing a new peacekeeping mission in Africa, the US ambassador indicated Washington would not support extensions unless financial efficiencies were found, reflecting Trump's push to cut costs.\n\n### Technology & Digital Sovereignty\n\nTrump's technology policy has focused on two main priorities:\n1. Accelerating US-China tech decoupling through:\n   - Tightened CFIUS restrictions on Chinese investment in critical sectors\n   - New controls on outbound US investment to China\n   - Additional export restrictions on advanced technologies\n   - Review of Chinese apps like TikTok with potential ban if not divested\n\n2. Pulling back from cooperative transatlantic tech governance:\n   - Downgrading the US-EU Trade and Technology Council to a low-level forum\n   - Minimal engagement with EU digital regulations like DMA, DSA and AI Act\n\nDomestically, Trump has adopted a generally laissez-faire approach except on national security matters, showing little interest in antitrust actions against tech giants or digital regulation.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU is pursuing its own technological sovereignty strategy:\n- The €43 billion Chips Act entered implementation phase, with the Commission approving state aid for several semiconductor fabrication facilities\n- Finalizing the AI Act to establish comprehensive artificial intelligence regulation\n- Continuing implementation of Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act\n- Exploring a potential UK-EU tech council to fill the gap left by US disengagement\n\nThese parallel but diverging approaches are creating a more fragmented global technology landscape based on competing governance models.\n\n### Circular Economy & Sustainability Initiatives\n\nDespite headwinds at the global level, there have been significant developments in circular economy and sustainability efforts, particularly led by Europe.\n\nIn late November 2024, delegates from over 150 countries met in Busan, South Korea for negotiations on a Global Plastics Treaty. After a week of talks, the negotiations failed to reach consensus due to key divisions: whether the pact's rules should be uniform globally or left to each nation, whether targets would be mandatory or voluntary, and how to address plastics' chemical additives. Countries like the US and Saudi Arabia favored a looser approach, while the EU and many developing nations pushed for bold global measures. The talks were adjourned until mid-2025.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe continues to lead circular economy implementation:\n- On February 11, 2025, the EU-wide Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation came into force\n- The new rules mandate increased reuse and recycling while phasing out unnecessary single-use packaging\n- Right to Repair regulations now require phone and tablet manufacturers to make spare parts available for at least 5 years\n- Development of rules to curb fast fashion waste is advancing\n\nOutside Europe, China announced in January 2025 an update to its \"National Circular Economy Strategy,\" with goals to dramatically improve recycling of metals and e-waste by 2030. African nations have also been active: Rwanda and Nigeria are co-leading an African Circular Economy Alliance that launched a plan to harmonize policies on plastics and electronics management across the continent.\n\nIn the corporate sector, many multinational companies have doubled down on circular economy commitments, partly in response to consumer expectations and EU regulations. By early 2025, several big brands announced targets to use higher percentages of recycled content in their products packaging by 2030.</post_cutoff_knowledge>\n\n\n<knowledge_update_processing>\nThe information above describes significant developments that have occurred after the model's October 2024 knowledge cutoff. When conducting your analysis:\n\n1. BALANCED INTEGRATION\n- Reference these developments where relevant to your analysis\n- Consider them as early-stage developments whose full implications are still emerging\n- Incorporate them as examples of possible directional shifts, not as definitive future patterns\n\n2. MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES\n- Consider both proponents' views and critics' perspectives on these developments\n- Analyze both potential continuation scenarios and possible reversal/modification scenarios\n- Examine reactions and counter-movements to these developments\n\n3. EVIDENCE CONSIDERATION\n- Use these developments as concrete examples of how shifts in priorities can affect domains\n- Consider them alongside pre-cutoff historical patterns and established trends\n- Avoid treating these recent developments as the only possible trajectory\n\n4.

Each uncertainty has multiple possible outcomes, and 3-4 distinct scenarios are created by combining these outcomes in logical, consistent ways to cover the main possibility space of how the external environment could develop.\n\nThe scenarios are narrative-based, qualitative descriptions of plausible futures focusing on structural, fundamental changes in the operating environment. They are not probabilistic predictions, but rather tools for understanding different possible futures and their implications. The scenarios describe how various external forces and developments create distinctly different operating environments, serving as a foundation for strategic thinking rather than as strategic plans themselves.\n\nCLIENT QUESTION CONTEXT:\nThe client questions provided are indicators of their current thinking - useful as data points but not as constraints on your analysis. Remember that:\n- Client questions often reflect current preoccupations rather than long-term strategic needs\n- Questions typically reveal limited mental models and organizational blind spots\n- Clients are usually focused on symptoms rather than underlying structural dynamics\n- The true value of scenario work lies in expanding beyond their current perspective\n\nYour task is to develop a genuinely independent analysis that:\n- Identifies underlying forces that clients may not recognize as relevant\n- Explores domains and dynamics that fall outside their current awareness\n- Challenges implicit assumptions embedded in their questions\n- Achieves a significantly broader perspective than their current viewpoint\n\nDISTINGUISHING TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES:\n- Trends: Developments with relatively predictable trajectories that will occur in all scenarios (though their specific form may vary)\n- Uncertainties: Factors with multiple possible and significantly different outcomes that create meaningful variation between scenarios\n\nThe types of trends and uncertainties that work well for scenario building are:\n- External to organizations\n- Structural/fundamental in nature\n- Significant impact on the operating environment\n- For uncertainties specifically: independent of each other and able to drive distinctly different futures\n\nAPPROPRIATE SCALE:\n- Major societal, economic, or political shifts\n- Broad industry transformations\n- Fundamental changes in operating logic\n- System-level developments\n\nTITLE STYLE FOR UNCERTAINTIES:\n- Use extremely simple and direct phrases (typically 1-4 words)\n- Focus on a single domain or specific aspect of change\n- Use simple nouns or noun phrases that identify the domain clearly\n- Ensure immediate comprehensibility within the industry context\n- Avoid compound or abstract concepts\n- Make the uncertainty aspect implicit rather than explicit\n\nEXAMPLES OF APPROPRIATE FACTORS:\nTrends (with simple titles):\n- \"Digitalization\" - Continued integration of digital technologies across all aspects of society\n- \"Aging Demographics\" - Progressive aging of population in developed economies\n- \"Climate Change\" - Ongoing warming trends and increasing frequency of extreme weather events\n\nUncertainties (with simple titles):\nBased on actual Finnish scenario examples:\n- \"Geopolitics\" - Critical for global power relationships and international system structure\n- \"Economic Development\" - Essential for resource availability and operating environment stability\n- \"Regulatory Framework\" - Determines operational boundaries and compliance requirements\n\nEXAMPLES FROM DIFFERENT SECTORS:\nEnergy sector:\n- \"Geopolitics and global economy\"\n- \"Effects of climate change\"\n- \"European economic development\"\n- \"Energy policy\"\n\nEducation sector:\n- \"Internationalization\"\n- \"Education policy\"\n- \"Funding base\"\n- \"Student wellbeing\"\n\nConstruction sector:\n- \"Green transition\"\n- \"Value formation\"\n- \"Workforce availability\"\n- \"Industry regulation\"\n</General guidance>\n\nFirst, review the provided background analysis:\n<change_vector_analysis_results>{{CHANGE_VECTOR_ANALYSIS}}</change_vector_analysis_results>\n\n<analysis_integration_guidance>\nYour analysis must systematically build upon the comprehensive background analysis provided, following this structured approach:\n\n1.
